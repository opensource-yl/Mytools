Some scripts that I usually use.

1. PXE(Preboot execute environment) is a booting computers via a network tool. You can do whatever you want when you install your machine.
  This tools here are helping to setup a PXE automatically.

2. trs(translate) is a tool that I copy from an interesting guy Mort, whick is used for translating under Linux text mode.
